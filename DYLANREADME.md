BMI Calculator Challenge

The challenge is a chance for you to practise the Javascript you have learned so far. It is meant to be a little bit challenging, but we know you can do if if you persevere. 

Context - Mark and John are trying to calculate their Body Mass Index, and want to create some code which can do it for them.

This is calculated by using the formula:
BMI = mass/ height **2 

or 

BMI = mass/ (height x height)

1. Store Mark and John's mass and height in variables (use the test data to help fill this in)

TEST DATA 1: Mark's weights 78kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weighs 92kg and is 1.95m tall.

TEST DATA 2: Mark weighs 95kg and is 1.88m tall. John Weighs 85kg and is 1.76m tall


Then using these variables calculate their BMI's, and log these results to the console. 

2. Calculate both their BMI's using the formula above. You can use either one. To make sure this is working log it into the console. 

3. Next, make a boolean variable called 'markHigherBMI' to see whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

4. Use an if/else statement to improve the BMI example by printing a statement to the console which says who has the higher BMI. You should also try to use ternary operators here to include the actual values of Mark and John's BMI's.
