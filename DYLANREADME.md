BMI Calculator Challenge

The challenge is a chance for you to practise the Javascript you have learned so far. It is meant to be a little bit challenging, but we know you can do if if you persevere. 

Some of the big tech firms in Auckland are setting up a social basketball league. So far there are Datacom, Rush, Xero, Spark, and Air New Zealand. Take2 has decided to enter a team of students and teachers.

Dylan and Kieran are doing some pre-season training and want to calculate and compare their Body Mass Index.

This is calculated by using the formula:
BMI = mass/ height **2 

or 

BMI = mass/ (height x height)


1. Store Sione and Stephen's mass and height in variables (use the test data to help fill this in)

TEST DATA 1: Sione weighs 78kg and is 1.69 m tall. Stephen weighs 92kg and is 1.95m tall.

TEST DATA 2: Sione weighs 95kg and is 1.88m tall. Stephen Weighs 85kg and is 1.76m tall


Then using these variables calculate their BMI's, and log these results to the console. 

2. Calculate both their BMI's using the formula above. You can use either one. To make sure this is working log it into the console. 

3. Next, make a boolean variable called 'sioneHigherBMI' to see whether Sione has a higher BMI than Stephen.

4. Use an if/else statement to improve the BMI example by printing a statement to the console which says who has the higher BMI. You should also try to use ternary operators here to include the actual values of Sione and Stephen's BMI's.
