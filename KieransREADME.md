Coding Challenge #3

Take2 and RUSH are competing against each other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins the trophy! üèÄüèÜ

1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below.

2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition, and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that as well (draw means they have the same average score).

3. BONUS 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a score of at least 100 points. HINT: Use a logical operator to test for minimum score, as well as multiple if-else blocks.

4. BONUS 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when both teams have the same score and both have a score greater than or equal to 100 points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy.

TEST DATA: Take2 scores 96, 108 and 89. RUSH scores 88, 91 and 110.

TEST DATA BONUS 1: Take2 scores 97, 112 and 101. RUSH scores 109, 95 and 123.

TEST DATA BONUS 2: Take2 scores 97, 112 and 101. RUSH scores 109, 95 and 106.

GOOD LUCK! üòÉ
